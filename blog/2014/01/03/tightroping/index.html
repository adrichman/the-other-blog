<p>Damn. This last week or so of my life has caught me feeling exceptionally fragile.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>
I have been struggling to manage responsibilities I took on as they all culminate in the same moment. While I agressively <a href="http://BrooklynStudioSale.com">marketed the studio</a> with Google Adwords, Facebook Ads and tons of posts and messages from <a href="http://twitter/Adam_D_Richman">my twitter</a> and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/adam.d.richman">facebook account</a>, things were coming together much slower than I hoped, while still creating a sense of light at the end of the tunnel. This felt so true that I pushed my travel back a few days to SF for <a href="http://www.hackreactor.com">Hack Reactor</a> because I really thought I was close to making a deal. Now I&rsquo;m not sure what the outcome will be, and any hope of it being resolved before I leave town is extinguished. And while I wanted a few days in SF to settle in before immersing into the insane program schedule, now I&rsquo;m left with about 36 hours before the going head-first into the fire.</p>

<p>But, it&rsquo;s reminding me of some important facts of life that are easy to say and not easy to experience. For that, I am grateful. Many things are never in our control, so I prefer not to pin my happiness on my hopes. It&rsquo;s a bonus when they come true, but I can&rsquo;t let their fruition be my necessity.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s terribly overwhelming to pack up the studio in the mindset of, possibly, not returning to it. There is a memory tucked into every nook. It has been a home for my passion and work, a home for my family and most recently a home for my new beginning. It&rsquo;s been a struggle to fully begin, however, among all these relics and ghosts. Packing up just unearths them and it feels all-the-more real, heavy, and sad.</p>

<p>The upside to my state of mind is that I can&rsquo;t wait for what&rsquo;s waiting for me, whatever it may be. It feels empowering to be facing such a big change with zero trepidation. I was sad to leave my intern post at <a href="http://www.ad60.com">AD60</a> and that makes me all-the-more stoked to become a &lsquo;real&rsquo; coder. I haven&rsquo;t been in a &lsquo;formal&rsquo; learning environment since 2001, so that&rsquo;s going to be quite a change of pace. I feel endlessly fortunate to have such an opportunity made available to me, and even more fortunate to have the ability to follow it down.</p>

<p>And the lingering question on my mind&hellip; Is this my last day living in New York City?</p>
