It's been a minute since I addressed my friends at large, which is probably a good thing, because what friend enjoys hearing about a friend via broadcast? Still, some moments call for finding a less exhaustive approach to catching up, so hopefully this can fill in some blanks in the story entitled 'What the hell is going on with Adam?'


So here's what's up.

##2013 has been pivotal
------------------------
Being a studio owner had begun to feel quite stifling.
I realized I want to learn more from people who are smarter than I; I believe I can grow a lot faster when surrounded by others.
There was little joy left in my work. Everything felt more difficult than it ever had before.
The rest of my life suffered along side my discontent.
Lisa and I separated and divorced.

The beginning of this year had me emotionally reeling in all of these feelings. I began work to achieve balance in each day:
I practiced [the artistâ€™s way](http://www.amazon.com/The-Artists-Way-Julia-Cameron/dp/1585421464) and re-sparked my creativity. 
I began [eating for my blood type](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_type_diet), running regularly and [practicing yoga](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018SLEF8).
I began to develop an idea for an app by which I became very inspired.
This led to me getting serious about learning to build the first version of the app.
I took courses online ( http://startup.stanford.edu/, http://codeschool.com ) and became all the more driven and intrigued.
I submitted extensive applications to a few competitive, immersive coding programs.
I began interning for a digital agency here in brooklyn ([AD:60](http://www.ad60.com)).
After multiple technical interviews, I was offered a spot at [Hack Reactor](http://hackreactor.com) in San Fransisco, and I accepted.
I will begin there in the first week of 2014, and will, hopefully, come up for air 12 weeks later as a much better programmer.

##Learning to fly
-------------------
Being a musician has long felt to be a defining quality for me, and moreso as being a career musician, rather than a musician by love and talent. I don't remember a time when I felt like my identity as a musician didn't walk into a room one step ahead of me.

I recall that for a long time, my canned, and candid, response to compliments regarding my gift - the luck of being "talented" - was always the same. "The gift," I'd explain with genuine humility, "is that I have the fire to go hack at this every day." I never took for granted that I was driven to move forward. 

And I took notice when that feeling left. I waited it out for a long time, without the ability to even indicate to myself what would make me happy. I turned my whole life upside down, pining for something that could make me happy again. Which really confirms my notion of happiness - that I find it in that space where hopes reside. Not a need to see dreams become reality, but simply a need to dream.

I was overwhelmed with fear. Of not living up to my own potential, of disappointing everyone in my life, of being an inadequate partner, of being a failure and a hack. (All of this is classically symptomatic of depression, but I mistook it for my universal truth for a very long time.)

Fear is fucking oppressive, and as pointless as it is powerful. I made my way past the fears that I had long allowed to rule my actions, and my life and destiny felt like it belonged to me for the first time in many, many years. While visions of my future were vanishing right before me, the abyss that remained was far less daunting than the prospect of carrying all of that fear and pain into the future that belonged to a life I had chosen many years ago.

Damnit if it doesn't feel good to be on the other side of that. I don't imagine that anything could again make me feel that affraid and paralyzed in my own life. When I faced my greatest fear, all other fear just melted away.

And so as not to abstract all of this "real talk" with heady bullshit - I didn't brain my way through this on my own. It took, and it still takes, good therapy and medication to get me out of the fetal position and back on my feet. And if that feels like that's more honesty than you're used to hearing - than that is why I feel obligated to include it. There is a lot of shitty, judge-y stigma around mental health and pharma. My feeling is that it's a miracle on earth and fuck anyone who thinks otherwise.

I am on a journey, for now, to discover and separate the man from the musician. Not to cut music out from my life - it will always be as crucial to me as oxygen - but to come out from under it and walk with another purpose. In my musical career, I never stuck to one sound, genre or aesthetic. I am acutely aware of how much that restlessness is baked into my disposition. I am at peace knowing that my life may be a series of curious non-sequitors. But I am also very single-mindedly focussed right now on this next phase, of learning, meeting monumental challenges, and creating in a new medium. I feel great.

I'm learning to be a coder. Fear is an all-ruling, powerful force. [Welbutrin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bupropion) is a miracle. I'm studying in San Fransisco from Jan '14 - Apr '14. Single and ready to mingle with javaScript.
